### BT(BitTorrent) Tracker Service

### Internet IP Address Query Service

Since the network may use multi-layer NAT address translation, IP address query for Internet egress:

* [ip.renfei.net](http://ip.renfei.net) : IPv4 and IPv6, IPv6 is generally preferred, depending on the DNS resolution of the client.
* [ipv4.renfei.net](http://ipv4.renfei.net) : IPv4 Only.
* [ipv6.renfei.net](http://ipv6.renfei.net) : IPv6 Only.
